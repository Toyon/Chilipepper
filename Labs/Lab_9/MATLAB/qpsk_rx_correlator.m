% There are two major goals with this core. The first is to find the peak
% of the training sequence and then to subsequently pull out and pack the
% bits. The number of bytes transmitted is in the packet so we extract this
% to determine how many bytes to pull out. 
% The second goal is to send these bytes off to the Microblaze processor.
