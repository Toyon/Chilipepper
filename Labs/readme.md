The goal of these laboratory exercises is to demonstrate a flow that uses Mathworks HDL Coder with MATLAB to HDL code generation, Xilinx tools, and the Toyon Chilipepper board. The exercises should be run in progression and include:

A "Lab_0" to introduce the user to the flow by Blinking LEDs on the ZED board

The remaining labs include:

1. Output a tone
2. Receive a tone
3. Output a QPSK pattern
4. Correct the received waveforms DC Offset
5. Achieve carrier lock on a QPSK pattern
6. Determine timing offset on a QPSK pattern
7. Receive and decode a transmitted pattern
8. Interface a processor with receiver in order to output a message
9. Interface Transmit with processor to send/recieve a message (QPSK Demo)
