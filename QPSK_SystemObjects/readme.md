Files in this directory provide a demonstration for a complete QPSK ad hoc wireless transceiver.

The complete set of code for the physical layer is written in MATLAB and translated to hardware using Mathworks HDL Coder. 

The MAC and peripheral (serial port) interfaces are written in C.

Note, this example was written in HDL Coder with MATLAB entry based on MathWorks R2013a and Xilinx 14.2 tools.

This example is largely meant to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow using HDL Coder with MATLAB entry and does not use some of the newer system object available in the Communications Toolbox.
