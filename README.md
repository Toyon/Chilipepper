Chilipepper
===========

This repository hosts projects related to the Toyon Research Corporation Chilipepper FMC radio board. The board can be purchased here
<http://www.toyon.com/chilipepper.php>. All supporting guides and demonstration files are found off this page on github.

Philosophy
----------

Generally, this repository is meant to provide two major components. The first is a set of tutorials on how to use [MathWorks](http://www.mathworks.com) HDL Coder™, specifically via MATLAB® to HDL code generation, along with Xilinx tools. These include the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) and Xilinx System Generator™. These laboratory exercises can be found in the "Labs" directory.

These laboratory exercises eventually lead up to the second component, which is a QPSK ad hoc modem exmample. This is found in the QPSK_Radio directory.

As Chilipepper is meant more as a learning tool than a true product we encourage other open source projects. Please contact <embedded@toyon.com> if you are interested in contributing.

Support
-------

The Chilipepper User's Guide and firmware for the microcontroller can be found in the ChilipepperSupport directory. You may submit issues and feature requests through github or contact us at <embedded@toyon.com>.
